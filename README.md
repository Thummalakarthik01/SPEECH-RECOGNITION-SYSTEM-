# Speech Recognition System

This project is a simple Speech Recognition System built using Python. It captures audio input from the user, converts the speech to text, and displays or processes the recognized text accordingly.

## Features

- Real-time speech-to-text conversion
- Supports microphone input
- Uses Google's Speech Recognition API
- Simple CLI or GUI integration (optional)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - speechrecognition
  - pyaudio (for microphone input)
  - pyttsx3 (optional, for text-to-speech)

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install speechrecognition pyaudio pyttsx3

## How to Run the Speech Recognition System

1. *Install Python*  
   Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from:  

2. *Install Required Libraries*  
   Open your terminal (or Anaconda Prompt) and run:
